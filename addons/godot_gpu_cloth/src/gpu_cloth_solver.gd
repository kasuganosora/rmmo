# v3.0 substrate: shared main RenderingDevice + Texture2DRD output, render-thread
# callable submission. Compute writes per-frame positions/normals into storage
# images that the spatial vertex shader reads via texelFetch (two-step lookup
# through a welded_index_tex). No CPU readback, no ArrayMesh rebuild.
#
# Phase 2 adds on top of Phase 1:
#  - UV-seam welding (spatial-hash welder; render mesh keeps un-welded slots,
#    simulation runs on welded particles).
#  - Topology-driven structural + diagonal bending constraints.
#  - K-nearest fishing-line tension propagation, anchored to Marker3D pins.
#  - cloth_pin_override compute pass to plug marker positions into the predict
#    pipeline's "anchored particles snap to skinned_target" mechanism (Hazard 4).
#
# Hazards honored: 1 (welded-space adjacency), 2 (skeleton-local colliders),
# 3 (fork's 48 B bone-matrix encoding), 5 (fishing on predicted, mid-substep,

## drapes naturally; it just gives the body a clearance buffer at render time.
## Live-tweakable (changes apply immediately without re-init). Pairs with

## The cloth genuinely simulates with this clearance — pinned edges hang

## (no constraint warping). Pairs with [member cloth_render_offset]

@export var inertia_scale: Vector3 = Vector3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
## Rotational counterpart. When the skeleton rotates, free particles lag behind
## the rotation by this fraction. 0 = particles ride along (rotate with the
## skeleton); 1 = particles fully stay where they were while the skeleton
## rotated. Anchored particles (cloth_weight=0 or marker-pinned) ignore this —

## Single skinned MeshInstance3D source for every body-derived collider this

## [br]• [member body_collider_voxel_resolution] > 0 → decimated triangle
##   mesh collider (voxel-clustered, single-bone-skinned per frame; the

@export var body_mesh: NodePath
## Bone-weight count threshold that filters which bones get auto-capsules.
## 0 = off (no auto-colliders). Each level lowers the qualifying threshold:

## 2 = medium — > 10 weighted verts (+ hands, feet, head, ~12-18 capsules);
## 3 = high — > 0 weighted verts (every weighted bone, ~25-40 capsules).
## Higher LOD = better silhouette fit at proportional per-frame collider cost
## (each capsule = one O(N) particle loop pass in the collide shader).
@export_range(0, 3) var auto_collider_lod: int = 0
## Percentile of bone-weighted vert distances used to set each capsule's radius.
## 1.0 = max (fits every vert but inflates around outliers — single clavicle
## vert weighted to a shoulder bone makes the upperarm capsule huge); 0.85 =
## 85th percentile (ignores the top 15% outliers, much tighter fit). Lower for

@export_range(0.5, 1.0) var auto_collider_radius_percentile: float = 0.85
## Global multiplier on auto-collider radii after percentile fit. Useful for
## scenes where you want to dial the whole set thicker (e.g., 1.1 = 10 % more
## clearance) without re-authoring the body mesh weights. Pairs with

## Minimum bone-weight a vertex needs to be claimed by that bone for radius
## fitting. Verts in joint regions (knee, elbow, neck-to-shoulder) often have
## split weights between two bones (e.g., 0.55 / 0.45) — without a tight
## threshold, those border verts get assigned to whichever bone wins slightly,
## inflating that bone's capsule with off-axis verts. 0.7 means a vert needs to
## be at least 70 % weighted to a bone to count; joint border verts get skipped
## entirely (they're not really "anyone's verts"). Raise to 0.85 for very tight
## fit (may lose some legitimate verts on smooth-weighted regions); lower to
## 0.5 if too many bones come out with too few verts to qualify for the LOD
## threshold.

## 3 = dense (every 4th, ~800-1500 spheres).
## Sphere cloud is an additive layer on top of [member auto_collider_lod]
## capsules — capsules give cheap bulk coverage, spheres fill in irregular
## areas (neck, shoulders, hands) where capsules can't fit. Each sphere is
## skinned to its dominant bone and packed alongside capsules in the collider
## buffer (same shader code path: a sphere is a degenerate capsule with a == b).
@export_range(0, 3) var body_sphere_lod: int = 0

## Decimation grid resolution for the triangle mesh collider built from

## [br]• 32 = medium (~200-500 tris).
## [br]• 64+ = fine; only needed for very detailed bodies.
## [br]Per-frame cost = O(particle_count × tri_count × iters × substeps), so

## Coulomb friction coefficient at cloth-collider contacts (primitive
## capsule/sphere/box, body triangle mesh, AND peer cloth — all three paths
